          female:pressure is a transnational online database and network of women*, AFAB, transgender, transfeminine,
          transmasculine, intersex [+gender optional], genderqueer, gender nonconforming, a-gender and/or non-binary
          DJs, musicians, composers, producers, visual artists, agents, journalists and researchers working in the
          realms of electronic music and visual arts. It is a publicly accessible source of information, a means of
          communication and a tool to disclose the existence and the work of women*, non-binary, transgender and gender
          fluid people in this seemingly cis-male dominated field. In 2021, female:pressure celebrates its 23rd
          anniversary.

          Founded by Vienna based
          <b-link class="f-link" href="http://indigo-inc.at/" target="_blank">Electric Indigo</b-link>
          in 1998, female:pressure is the technological answer to the recurring assertions of an alleged lack of female*
          artists in this field. The project started out as a simple html list until Viennese media artist and open
          source expert
          <b-link class="f-link" href="https://twitter.com/turtlestitch" target="_blank">Andrea Mayr</b-link>
          programmed the database in 2001. With about 180 listed artists from 19 countries 20 years ago, female:pressure
          can now be proud of including over 2700 members from 82 countries [May 2021]. Members can log in and update
          their individual profile, most of the profiles link to the artists' web pages and contain contact information.

          "Why are there so few women in the electronic music scene?" We have heard this question countless times. While
          we think that the perceived lack of gender diversity is caused by a complex combination of societal factors,
          experience shows that women* are hardly less active. In fact, their activities are less recognised and
          additionally often forgotten in historiography. Raising visibility [and audibility] of players in the
          electronic music scenes is therefore one of our main goals.

        <h3>vision</h3>
        <p>
          The female:pressure project is continuously growing and advancing. Initially planned as a mere insight into
          the status quo, it now also serves an archival purpose with links to works of artists who are no longer active
          or who are sadly deceased. Over the years, we broadened the simple focus on women in favour of an explicit
          inclusion of transgender and non-binary members. We practice an intersectional and anti-racist approach to our
          work and try to listen to and learn from each other on the female:pressure mailing list.

        <p>
          The mailing list has been the primary medium of communication within the network since 2004 and about half of
          the artists listed in the database are subscribed to it. Important results of the list's activities are our
