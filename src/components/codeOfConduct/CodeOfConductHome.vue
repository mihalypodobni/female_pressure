      code of conduct

        <h4>introduction</h4>
        <p>
          female:pressure is built on trust and therefore dedicated to providing an experience of mutual respect for
          everyone. We can neither tolerate harassment of participants in any form nor attitudes of prerogative,
          privilege and discrimination.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many years, we did not have an explicit code of conduct because we thought that based on the personal
          contacts within our network, cordial interaction was self-evident. However, having a code of conduct is often
          an indicator that a project has a sizable quantity of contributors. Not only did our number of members
          increase by over 1500 percent in 20 years, we now also comprise people from more than 80 countries with many
          different cultural backgrounds. And yes, we want to grow further. Communication and collaboration within such
          a diverse multitude of people requires empathy, attention, listening, sometimes diplomacy and always a clear
          and fair-spoken mode of expression.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-4">
        <h4>scope of application</h4>
        <p>
          This code of conduct applies to all female:pressure spaces, including our mailing lists, Facebook groups and
          Discord channel, both online and offline. Even though we are dedicated to mediating conflicts within the
          network first, anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the
          discretion of the awareness team [please see more in consequences below].
        </p>
        <p>
          Some female:pressure spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to
          participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-4">
        <h4>harassment</h4>
        Harassment includes:
        <ul>
          <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, age, social
            status,
            class, caste, disability, mental illness, neuroatypicality, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
            nationality or religion
          </li>
          <li>Unsolicited comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to
            food,
            health, parenting, drugs, employment, and sex work
          </li>
          <li>Deliberate misgendering or use of rejected names, deliberate deadnaming or disrespect of preferred
            personal
            pronouns when this has been made clear
          </li>
          <li>Deliberate mislabelling of geographic entities [e.g. the use of 'America' or 'Americans' for the USA or US
            citizens respectively and thus ignoring the majority of South, Central and North America]
          </li>
          <li>Hate speech or deliberate intimidation</li>
          <li>Sustained disruption of discussion or trolling</li>
          <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
          <li>Stalking or following</li>
          <li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with
            others
          </li>
          <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they're not appropriate</li>
          <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact [eg, textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub"] without
            consent or after a request to stop
          </li>
          <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
          <li>Threats of violence</li>
          <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to
            engage in self-harm
          </li>
          <li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes</li>
          <li>Deliberate 'outing' of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent</li>
          <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-4">
        <h4>abuse of trust</h4>
        <p>
          The abuse of trust within the network is extremely damaging for its development. Misappropriation of
          intellectual property amongst female:pressure members is a worst case scenario in this regard, in particular
          if the wronged party is a member of a marginalized group. Such behaviour will not be tolerated. For example,
          the use of Aboriginal/Indigenous music, storytelling and wordplay must be 100% supported by the
          Aboriginal/Indigenous person, stakeholder or owner of original property or it cannot be reproduced in any
          analog or digital format.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-4">
        <h4>reservation</h4>
        female:pressure prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. Therefore, our
        awareness team reserves the right <b>not</b> to act on:
        <ul>
          <li>Complaints regarding ‘reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism’, ‘reverse sexism’ and ‘cisphobia’</li>
          <li>Complaints regarding reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone”, “go away” or “I’m
            not discussing this with you”
          </li>
          <li>Complaints regarding communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial</li>
          <li>Complaints regarding criticism of racist, sexist, transphobic, or otherwise oppressive behavior or
            assumptions
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-4">
        <h4>reporting</h4>
        <p>
          If you are being harassed by a member of female:pressure, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
          any other concerns, please contact the awareness team at concierge@femalepressure.net. If the person who is
          harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves and we will assign an external facilitator to handle
          your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.
        </p>
        <p>
          This code of conduct applies to female:pressure spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of
          female:pressure outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all reports of harassment by
          female:pressure members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that takes place
          at any point in time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to
          have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we
          may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties
          about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of female:pressure members or the general
          public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-4">
        <h4>consequences</h4>
        <p>
          While the awareness team will try to mediate in case of conflicts within the community, participants asked to
          stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Mediation efforts may include gathering
          relevant information such as statements from the harassed person, harasser, any witnesses, and/or relevant
          documents so that the awareness team may comment and take action with a full understanding of the offence.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the awareness team may take any action they deem appropriate,
          up to and including expulsion from all female:pressure spaces and identification of the participant as a
          harasser to other female:pressure members or the general public.

        <h4>mailing list netiquette</h4>
        <p>
          In addition to the above general code of conduct, we'd like to ask you to respect the following rules and
          recommendations for posting to our mailing list:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We ask you to use greetings that don't alienate our non-binary and transgender members.<br>
            If you decide to use a salutation that is not gender neutral [e.g. "hey ladies"], then please add a more
            inclusive salutation to also greet those who don't identify as whom you addressed initially.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please be aware of accumulated message footers in longer threads.<br>
            The mailing list is configured for a maximum message size of 40 KB. If your message is bigger than that, it
            is
            held for approval. This means more work for the administrator. Often, the maximum message size is exceeded
            just because of a long thread with a lot of footers accumulated at the bottom of your message. Simply delete
            all the "female:pressure mailing list" infos and your message will become a lot smaller.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please do not try to post images, PDFs or any other attachments to the list!<br>
            Image files are almost always too big for a 40 KB message size. The list is configured in a way that it
            automatically strips images from the message but such messages are still held for approval. This means more
            work for the administrator.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please do not use the reply-to-all function for single word messages unless you think it's absolutely
            necessary.<br>
            Our mailing list is extremely lively and produces a lot of traffic. We have over 1200 subscribers. If you
            just
            hit "reply" instead of "reply to all", your message will go to the original sender only.
          </li>
          <li>
            We ask you to refrain from all caps messages, message parts or subject lines as it is the written equivalent
            of yelling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Generally, the tone on the list is friendly and to the point.
          </li>
